# Lume

A communication App using PECS for children with Autism, there is also a sign langague page to keep up with signs your are working on with your child to master. 

## Motivation

I have two Austitic kids, one is my bonus son who is a teen and a toddler who is currently non-verbal! My motivation for this app is to help any parent with Autistic children be able to gelp them communicate. PECS is a picture communication system where the child is able to form sentences by pointing out pictures to show the words they want to say, Communication isn't just verbal!
